- More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_, and even \*italics and later **bold\***. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

The end ...
