Трима пича така се изкефили, че са се събрали, че дори извикали : [We Have Band](http://www.myspace.com/wehaveband) !


Това станало и име на бандата им. Ето и първото им видео.

[We Have Band - Oh! (Music Video)](http://vimeo.com/2089802) from [We Have Band](http://vimeo.com/user880474) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).


Ето и няколко мили думи от световни медии:


NME – “An adventurous and modernist concoction of post-new rave DIY sambapunkdisco jiggery-pokery that’ll come as a shot of distorted filth

in the arm for an overflowing UK electro-pop scene... They got band. We found heroes.”


GUARDIAN – “Part Hot Chip, part Talking Heads, if Fischerspooner topped Emerge it would sound like this… If someone doesn’t sign them, and sharp-ish,

we’ll have a whip round and do it ourselves.”


DAZED & CONFUSED - “A hectic, bass-heavy synth-pop odyssey that sounds something like Can being covered by Buggles.”


TIME OUT LONDON – “We would describe We Have Band as ‘the new Hot Chip’ if that wasn’t being unfair to both bands. Their icy glitch-rock is already having them hailed as one of the top tips for 2009.”
